    <p>Born and raised in Succasunna, NJ, I spent the first half of my life in a suburban town unaware of the world outside of New Jersey. When I turned 18, I began my journey to SCAD, a small art college in Savannah, Georgia. Over the next five years I would have many wonderful oppurtunities to travel during my studies. Upon finishing my Masters degree at SCAD, due to a depressed economy, I reluctantly moved home - unaware of what the future would hold. After getting a job with the worlds largest architecture firm, Gensler, I was able to continue my career in Austin, Texas after a transfer in 2012.</p>
